# -An Analysis of Retirement Data 
Performing analysis on retirement Data to illustrate trends. 
## Overview of Project 
In this project data is used to help illustrate the potential employees that will be retiring in the near future, this information can be used to help better understand future needs of the company and potential short falls in staffing and department capability. The company can also use this information to help better their hiring or training process to ensure that once employees retire there is not a down turn in productivity. 
### Results
* The results of this analysis show that there is a large demographic of employees approaching the retirement mark, this can potentially lead to a massive downturn in productivity and potential profitability of the company. The company has tried to mitigate the impact by creating a mentorship program in which retiring employees can essentially train in their replacements in a part time position before officially retiring. 
#### Summary 
* It would appear that a mentorship program would be highly effective in decreasing the possibilty of a potential downturn in productivity within the company, while there are a substantial amount of employees retiring there are also numerous employees that would be eligible to train into their new postions.
